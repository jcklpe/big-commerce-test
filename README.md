# Big Commerce Developer Documentation Specialist Test

Howdy,

Thanks for checking out my test results. It won't work if you run it as is, as I used an unpaid ngrok account but I have provided documentation for you to see the code that consumes the webhook data and pushes it to an html page.

I've never really written an app with webhooks or express.js so I found this to be a pretty fun learning experience.
